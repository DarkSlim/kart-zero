# kart-zero - fzero-like game prototype 


For some screenshots and video links : http://godotdevelopers.org/index.php?topic=15519.0


The ``/res`` forlder contains the sources of imported textures and meshes. 
There is a giant Gimp file missing because i could not upload it since it is 287 MB large.

I haven't write any documentation yet. Though, if you have questions i'll answer.

Good luck.
